      We are organizing a massive game of Twister, where 5000 people will play on a giant mat at the same time. This will be the largest game of Twister ever played, and we need your help to make it happen. All you need to do is fill out the form below and show up on the day of the event. It's free, it's fun, and it's for a good cause. We will donate all the proceeds from the event to a local charity that supports children with disabilities.

      The event will take place on Saturday, June 5th, 2023, at 10:00 AM, at the Central Park. The game will last for 30 minutes, and we will have music, snacks, and prizes for the participants. Don't miss this opportunity to be part of history and have a blast with your friends and family. Sign up now and spread the word!
